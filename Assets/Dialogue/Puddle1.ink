1st memory:
She saw the memory of her first crush during 8th grade, Gabriel, resurfaced with a wistful tenderness. The vivid details of that time played in her mind like a perpetual state of twilight, with a gentle, warm, and timeless glow, reminiscent of the fading light of a setting sun, each frame capturing the innocence of youth and the ache of unspoken desires. She saw herself, a quiet observer on the sidelines, entranced by the charisma of a boy who seemed to embody all the magic life had to offer.

As Ava delved into the layers of her past, she felt the familiar pang of regret, a subtle ache for the girl who had hesitated on the precipice of confession. She watched the scenes unfold, the farewell party playing out like a cherished melody. The dance floor, once a realm of missed opportunities, became a stage where the younger Ava grappled with the courage to approach Gabriel. The unspoken words hung in the air like delicate threads, weaving a tale of longing and hesitation.

Ava can hear her younger self's thoughts for she is her back then. Her thoughts are filled with deeming herself not enough and putting him on a pedestal. From the end of the school year up to the present, she has avoided Gabriel because of embarrassment, anxiety, and regret.
