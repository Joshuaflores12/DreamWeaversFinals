3rd memory:
She saw a memory of her that only happened this year. She stood at the threshold of love, her heart pulsating with anticipation. The charismatic James entered her world, his promises resonating like sweet music that charmed her delicate spirit. What began as a serenade of affection, however, descended into a storm of verbal abuse, a tempest that eroded the foundations of Ava's self-worth.

The warning signs, etched into the memory of her soul, were overshadowed by the desperate desire for love. Ava, caught in the whirlwind of James's manipulation, clung to the belief that sacrifice was the currency of affection. The memory whispers of her silent suffering, a narrative etched in the bruises on her skin and the scars on her heart.

As the tragedy unfolded, Ava, driven by the misplaced belief that love demanded sacrifice, surrendered fragments of herself. Her dreams, friendships, and self-respect crumbled like petals caught in the wind. The memory deepens as Lily, consumed by the shadows of despair, makes a choice born out of distorted desperation. She almost turned into a lifeless form, almost bleeding from her self-inflicted wounds and all faded to black.
